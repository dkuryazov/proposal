Software modeling require team efforts in which group of experts from various fields work together. Close collaboration between them, especially, in a real-time environment, is important to the success of a development work. This is because software systems are getting larger and more complex, and developing these systems requires efforts from multiple designers, who may be geographically dispersed. Consequently, tools must exist to allow designers to collaborate effectively in each stage of a software development process.

The evolution and maintenance of complex software systems require the collaboration of several designers. The importance of real-time collaboration can be seen in many cases. For example, in case of learning, junior software designers can learn faster from experienced senior designers in developing process.

Therefore, real-time collaborative modeling system must be developed that will provide real-time synchronization over the network if the network is available, otherwise, all the additions, changes and deletions done by user should be stored on local machine and should submit these changes when the network is connected and available. Storing on local machine should be as in version control systems, i.e. there should be an opportunity to head back to evolution stages. Thereafter, when network is available changes made on the models should be sent to the repository. And should be found ways to resolve conflicts at this case.
